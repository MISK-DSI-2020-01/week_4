# Misk DSI 2020-01 Week 4

Welcome to the fourth week of the Misk DSI course. This week we'll wrap up our exploration of Data basics with a deep dive into Data Visualization with R.

This is also a good time to take a pause and have 1:2 meetings for each student with the instructor and the teaching assisstant. This will give us a chance to check in on any outstanding issues you have and to make sure that we're all on track. 

## Course material

The Data Visualization module is available [here](http://scavetta.academy/misk/dataviz/_book/understanding-the-purposes-of-data-visualization.html). We'll use a [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_kiQl5uU=/) to discuss the material in our group sessions.
